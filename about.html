        <h2>History of the ISUD</h2>
        <p>
          ISUD was founded in Warsaw, Poland in 1989. ISUD is a philosophical
          society dedicated to promoting international and intercultural
          dialogue among an ever-wider segment of humanity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main purpose of the society is to pursue, by means of scholarly
          work, the gradual realization of a decent, peaceful, and just world
          order. Towards this goal, ISUD produces biannual international
          conferences to facilitate an ethos of universal dialogue.
        </p>

        <p>
          ISUD is committed to promoting philosophical discourse intended to
          encourage the emergence of a more decent and humane world order by
          promoting dialogue to actualize the highest and richest human values
          in all dimensions of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          ISUD is a member of the International Federation of Philosophical
          Societies (FISP), is an international association of philosophers and
          scholars from a wide range of other disciplines (such as history,
          archaeology, pedagogy, anthropology, etc) devoted to promoting the
          discussion of such fundamental issues as world peace, social justice,
          human rights, and dialogical interrelations of diverse cultures.
        </p>
        <img id="athens" src="media/athens.jpg" alt="Athens picture" />
        <p>
          Since 2004, the ISUD has been one of 103 full members of the FISP that
          is linked with the International Council for Philosophy and Humanistic
          Studies (ICPHS) and with UNESCO. The goals of the ISUD are very much
          in line with the main objectives of FISP, ICPHS, and UNESCO: namely,
          to promote philosophical education on a global scale, and to generate
          a greater awareness of the social and global problems that confront us
          in order to break through the impasse in which humanity finds itself
          in the early 21st century.
