        <h2>Philosophy after Hiroshima</h2>
        <p>Newcastle upon Tyne: Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2010.</p>
        <p>
          Philosophy after Hiroshima offers a philosophical analysis of the
          issues surrounding war and peace, and their challenges to ethics. It
          reminds us that the threat posed to civilization by nuclear weapons
          persists, as does the need for continuing philosophical reflection on
          the nature of war, the problem of violence, and the need for a
          workable ethics in the nuclear age.
        </p>
        <p>
          The essays included in this volume were originally presented at the
          Seventh World Congress of the International Society for Universal
          Dialogue (ISUD), entitled After Hiroshima: Collective Memory,
          Philosophical Reflection and World Peace, hosted in Hiroshima, Japan,
          in the summer of 2007, and at the XXII World Congress of Philosophy,
          entitled Rethinking Philosophy Today, in Seoul, South Korea, in the
          summer of 2008.

        <h2>
          The Challenges of Globalization: Rethinking Nature, Culture, and
          Freedom
        </h2>
        <p>
          The essays included in this volume were selected from the 2005 Sixth
          World Congress of the International Society for Universal Dialogue
          held in Helsinki, Finland. Most were either keynote addresses or
          prize-winning papers at the Congress, and all are focused on a central
          theme: the need to rethink our concepts of nature, culture, and
          freedom in an age of increased globalization.
        </p>
        <p>
          These essays examine topics ranging from peace, global justice,
          international law, and human rights to cultural relativism and
          ecoterrorism. They discuss how a comprehensive ethical action is
          necessary in order to overcome repressive social, political, and
          cultural obstacles.

        <h2>Mythos and Logos: How to Regain the Love of Wisdom</h2>
        <p>
          This book contains fifteen essays selected from the Fourth World
          Congress of the International Society for Universal Dialogue, held in
          Krakow, Poland, 2001. The essays are seeking to regain the original
          meaning of philosophy as the love of wisdom. Mythos and Logos are two
          essential aspects of a quest that began with the ancient Greeks. As
          concepts foundational to human experience, Mythos and Logos continue
          to guide the search for truth in the 21st century.
